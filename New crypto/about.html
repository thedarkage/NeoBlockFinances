  <h2>The Evolution of Digital Currency</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency represents a revolutionary shift in the concept of money and financial technology. 
    At its core, cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making 
    it nearly impossible to counterfeit or manipulate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first and most iconic cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was introduced in 2009 by an unknown person or group 
    using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin demonstrated the power of decentralized finance, allowing 
    value to be exchanged without traditional banks or central authorities.
  </p>

  <h2>Major Types of Cryptocurrencies</h2>

  <h3>Bitcoin (BTC)</h3>
  <p>
    Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency. It functions as a store of value and is often referred to as 
    “digital gold.” Bitcoin runs on a decentralized blockchain network, where transactions are verified by miners.
  </p>

  <h3>Ethereum (ETH)</h3>
  <p>
    Ethereum is more than just a currency. It introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements 
    built on blockchain. This innovation opened doors to decentralized applications (dApps) and the world of 
    decentralized finance (DeFi).
  </p>

  <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
  <p>
    Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value by being pegged to real-world assets such as USD. 
    Examples include USDT and USDC. They offer price stability, making them useful for trading and remittances.
  </p>

  <h3>Altcoins</h3>
  <p>
    Altcoins refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Examples include Cardano, Binance Coin, and Solana. 
    Many altcoins were created to improve on Bitcoin’s speed, scalability, or functions.
  </p>

  <h3>Utility Tokens</h3>
  <p>
    Utility tokens grant access to specific services or platforms. For example, tokens like Chainlink (LINK) and 
    Polkadot (DOT) support blockchain ecosystems and technology infrastructure.

  <h2>The Future of Digital Finance</h2>
  <p>
    The world continues to explore blockchain for applications beyond currency, including supply chain tracking, 
    voting systems, identity management, gaming economies, and data security.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although cryptocurrencies come with volatility and regulatory challenges, they have sparked a global movement 
    toward decentralized technology, inspiring innovation in finance and beyond.
